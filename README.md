# Naive-Bayes-Python-Implementation
In machine learning, naïve Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models.[1] But they could be coupled with Kernel density estimation and achieve higher accuracy levels.

A simple term-frequency naive Bayes implementation in Python.  

This is a very rough implementation with lots of room for improvement.
